A collection of learning resources


Hi! Welcome to my collection of learning resources. Here, I will continue to add materials primarily focused on Machine Learning and Statistical Methods. Over time, I may reorganize these topics in a more structured and interpretable way for easier navigation.

## NLP/LLM
1. [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) - The seminal paper introducing transformers.
2. [The Illustrated Transformer - Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) - A wonderfully explained and visually rich guide to transformers.
3. [Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model (Mechanics of Seq2seq Models With Attention) - Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) - Another excellent illustration by Jay Alammar, focusing on the mechanics of attention in sequence-to-sequence models.
4. [How Transformer LLMs Work](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/how-transformer-llms-work/lesson/nfshb/introduction) - A free introductory course on Transformer LLMs by Jay Alammar, Maarten Grootendorst
5. [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) - (I have not checked this one yet. I will add my thoughts once I do.)
6. (https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1)[HuggingFace LLM Course] - A great course to get hands-on with large language models. I am following this course myself and keeping an updated repo with materials and code changes. Feel free to check it out! [here](https://github.com/avirupc/nlp/tree/main/HuggingFace%20LLM%20Course)

## TensorFlow
1. [TensorFlow official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/pandas_dataframe) - Looks like a comprehensive tutorial covering both beginner and advanced topics, with a focus on using TensorFlow for data processing.

## Python Basics
1.
