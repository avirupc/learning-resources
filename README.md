A collection of learning resources

Welcome to my collection of learning resources. Here, I will continue to add materials primarily focused on Machine Learning and Statistical Methods. Over time, I may reorganize these topics in a more structured and interpretable way for easier navigation.

## NLP/LLM
1. [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) - The seminal paper introducing transformers.

2. [The Illustrated Transformer - Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) - A wonderfully explained and visually rich guide to transformers. <br> 🗒️ My personal notes from this article are available [here](https://github.com/avirupc/nlp/blob/main/HuggingFace%20LLM%20Course/Chapter1%20-%20Transformer%20Models/1.4%20How%20do%20Transformers%20work/Notes%20from%20Illustrated%20Transformers.md).

3. [Visualizing A Neural Machine Translation Model (Mechanics of Seq2seq Models With Attention) - Jay Alammar](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) - Another excellent illustration by Jay Alammar, focusing on the mechanics of attention in sequence-to-sequence models.

4. [Understanding LSTM Networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) - A short, crisp description of LSTM networks for beginners.<br>
I recommend reviewing the basics of RNNs before diving into the LSTM stuff here. Although the article briefly introduces RNNs, it is still worthwhile to explore some core concepts, such as hidden states and time unrolling to build a stronger foundation.

5. [HuggingFace LLM Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter1/1) - A great course to get hands-on with large language models.<br>🖥️ I am following this course myself and keeping an updated repo with materials and code changes. Feel free to check it out [here](https://github.com/avirupc/nlp/tree/main/HuggingFace%20LLM%20Course).

6. [Neural Machine Translation (seq2seq) Tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt?tab=readme-ov-file#introduction) - A turorial from TensorFlow

Note: Lectures from Professor Madhavan Mukund (CMI) on RNN and LSTM are quite good and should be checked for fundamentals.

## TensorFlow
1. [TensorFlow official tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/pandas_dataframe) - Looks like a comprehensive tutorial covering both beginner and advanced topics, with a focus on using TensorFlow for data processing.

## Python Basics
1. https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises - A great repo for practising Pandas. I often brush up on my Pandas skills using this repo from time to time and my solutions and additions can be found [here](https://github.com/avirupc/pandas-exercises).
